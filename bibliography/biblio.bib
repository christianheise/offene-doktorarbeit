  abstract = {Open Access (OA) as a new form of distributing scientific literature is broadly accepted by scholars; but in most disciplines the realization of the paradigm is progressing rather slowly. The reason for this lies; on the one hand; in a lack of incentives for individual authors. On the other hand; there are many different approaches to OA and their effects on market participants are complex. In this article we regard the implications of different OA models for scholars; publishers; libraries and funding organizations and try to explain the motivations behind the actions currently taking place on the scientific publishing market.},
